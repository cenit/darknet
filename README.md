# Yolo (FLIR branch)

Get ready using YOLO following the usual [user guide](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/README.md).
Afterwards, move scripts from the scripts/flir folder inside the root folder of Darknet.
Launch `train_flir.ps1` on Windows, `train_flir_container.sh` on linux (at least one nvidia GPU is a must in both cases)
